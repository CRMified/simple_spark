# SimpleSpark

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/leadmachineapp/simple_spark.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/leadmachineapp/simple_spark) [![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/simple_spark.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/simple_spark)

This gem is an alternative to the [official Ruby gem](https://github.com/SparkPost/ruby-sparkpost) provided by [SparkPost](http://www.sparkpost.com)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'simple_spark'
```

And then execute:

```
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

```
$ gem install simple_spark
```

## Usage

### Why?

The official gem was somewhat lacking in functionality, though with the demise of Mandrill it seems SparkPost has decided to restart development on it.

But, not being in a mood to wait, and as we would have to write wrappers around all the functions we would need anyway, it seemed much easier to write the wrapper as a gem and allow others to use it too.

Development on the offical gem steams ahead, but I still prefer the more 'ruby-like' nature of this approach and the lack of such tight depenedency on the Sparkpost API

### Status

Breaking change: initialising the client is now done with a hash instead of with ordered parameters, as there were getting to be too many after supporting Subaccounts and user specified headers

## Endpoints

### Creating a Client

First you need to ensure you are requiring the library

```ruby
require 'simple_spark'
```

The simplest version of the client is to just provide your [API key from SparkPost](https://app.sparkpost.com/account/credentials)

```ruby
simple_spark = SimpleSpark::Client.new(api_key: 'your_api_key')
```

You can also use ENV vars to configure the key, setting ENV['SPARKPOST_API_KEY'] will allow you to just use

```ruby
simple_spark = SimpleSpark::Client.new
```

You can also override the other options if you need to in advanced scenarios, the full signature is (api_key, api_host, base_path, debug), i.e.

```ruby
simple_spark = SimpleSpark::Client.new(api_key: 'your_api_key', api_host: 'https://api.sparkpost.com',  base_path: '/api/v1/', debug: false, subaccount_id: 'my_subaccount')
```

#### Debug

Setting debug to true will cause [Excon](https://github.com/excon/excon) to output full debug information to the log.

This will default to true if you are running under Rails and are in a development environment, otherwise it will default to false (setting other values to nil will cause them to use their defaults)

#### Subaccounts

By setting subaccount_id on your client you are telling Simple Spark to use that subaccount for all calls made on this instance of the client.

Not all Sparkpost calls support the Subaccount feature, and their API will throw an unauthorized error if you use a subaccount_id on an unsupported call. Depending on your code this may mean you need to instantiate two instances of the Simple Spark client in your code, one for subaccount calls, and one for other calls. This is a less than ideal solution, but due to the rapid pace of Sparkpost development on their API this is the option that causes least dependency up Simple Spark to be updated as their API is.

#### Headers

Should you have any need to override the headers that are sent by default, then you can specify headers as an option. The headers specified here will override any of the generated headers that the library creates. In normal operation there should be no reason to use this option, but it is provided for convenience and to allow for Sparkpost updating their API in any unexpected way.

```ruby
simple_spark = SimpleSpark::Client.new(api_key: 'your_api_key', headers: { 'NewSparkpostHeader' => 'hello'})
```

### Transmissions

#### List

List all Transmissions

When messages are sent the Transmission will be deleted, so this will only return transmissions that are about to be sent or are scheduled for the future

```ruby
simple_spark.transmissions.list
```

<a href="https://developers.sparkpost.com/api/#/reference/transmissions/list" target="_blank">see SparkPost API Documentation</a>

#### Create

Create a new Transmission

```ruby
properties = {
  options: { open_tracking: true, click_tracking: true },
  campaign_id: 'christmas_campaign',
  return_path: 'bounces-christmas-campaign@sp.neekme.com',
  metadata: {user_type: 'students'},
  substitution_data: { sender: 'Big Store Team' },
  recipients:  [
    { address: { email: 'yourcustomer@theirdomain.com', name: 'Your Customer' },
      tags: ['greeting', 'sales'],
      metadata: { place: 'Earth' }, substitution_data: { address: '123 Their Road' } }
  ],
  content:
  { from: { name: 'Your Name', email: 'you@yourdomain.com' },
    subject: 'I am a test email',
    reply_to: 'Sales <sales@yourdomain.com>',
    headers: { 'X-Customer-CampaignID' => 'christmas_campaign' },
    text: 'Hi from {{sender}} ... this is a test, and here is your address {{address}}',
    html: '<p>Hi from {{sender}}</p<p>This is a test</p>'
  }
}

simple_spark.transmissions.create(properties)
```

To send attachments, they need to be Base64 encoded

```ruby
require 'base64'

properties = {
  recipients:  [{ address: { email: 'yourcustomer@theirdomain.com', name: 'Your Customer' }],
  content:
  { from: { name: 'Your Name', email: 'you@yourdomain.com' },
    subject: 'I am a test email',
    html: '<p>Hi from {{sender}}</p<p>This is a test</p>',
    attachments: [{ name: "attachment.txt", type: "text/plain", data: attachment }]
  }
}

# load your file contents first, then use Base64 to encode them
encoded_attachment = Base64.encode64('My file contents')
properties[:content][:attachments] = [{ name: "attachment.txt", type: "text/plain", data: encoded_attachment }]

simple_spark.transmissions.create(properties)
